Jérôme works at Docker, where he helps others to containerize all the things. He was part of the team that built, scaled, and operated the dotCloud PAAS, before it became Docker. When annoyed he threatens to replace things with a very small shell script.

I have over a decade of experience in the trenches as an automation and performance engineer, I worked across a number of industries, from government - military and financial services to small start-ups. During my career I founded and managed Automation groups in companies like Tescom, ITG, eToro and Supersonic.

I'm patient about Automation and believe that everything can be automated : "Run automation tests from first line and keep your automation green" I'm also fan of cooking and addicted to culinary TV shows.
