>If you thought Continuous Delivery was “the future”, you are falling behind the curve.
>
>In this hands on workshop, we will have a look at how Docker is already making ‘classic’ CoDe setups look old-school …
You will learn how to set up a Jenkins based continuous delivery environment running in Docker containers.  We will use this to build, test and deploy a well known open source project using stock and custom Docker containers for the various tasks.
>
>Along the way, you will gain experience building and running your own Docker containers, use Jenkins CI and its Docker plugin, and have built and run a project all within the confines of Docker containers running on cloud infrastructure.
>
> **Prerequisites**
>
>Every participant is expected to:
>
>  - bring a laptop with a working SSH client (any OS)
>  - have an account on GitHub (takes 2 minutes or less if you don’t have one).
>  - Have basic experience with Docker, maybe from the Docker 101 workshop earlier in the day, or from an evening playing at home.  I.e. you have a basic understanding of the Docker concept, and at least tried to pull and run existing images, and preferably at least tried to build one from a Dockerfile. Experience with Docker Compose and Docker Swarm is not necessary.
