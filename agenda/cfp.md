###Continuous Delivery & DevOps Copenhagen - 2014

The agenda is being prepared - we're asking for papers! Submit anything you have - or if you'd like to recommend a good speaker on the topic of Continuous delivery and DevOps tweet it on [#codecph](/social/tweets.html).

We're adopting the TED Commandments - they are well thought through and proven.
