## Continuous Deployment: What happens afterwards
{: #afterwards}

### Keynote

### Jim Coplien, Gertudandcope

![Jim Coplien](/cph15/images/speakers/jcoplien.jpg){: .round #left}

Jim Coplien has over 40 years of experience in software development and has been a pioneer of object-oriented design, agile development process, and software patterns. He has written books covering a versatile spectrum of disciplines ranging from organizational structure to programming. Cope leads and facilitates the industry Scrum PLoP® community effort (scrumplop.org) to create a de facto standard of rationalized Scrum.

Jim gives a refreshingly different view on continuous-x in his keynote. This is the abstract in his own words:

>Continuous deployment helps the enterprise finish its work and ready the product for delivery into the client’s hands at a moment’s notice. Technology can triumph over uncertainty. But the bigger challenges lie in managing the market expectations, and those of the people outside the enterprise — the end users. It’s less about being always ready to synchronise with their readiness rather than theirs. Software is never just a product, and delivers value only when running and providing a service. So it’s not really about either the product nor about delivery. It must be a living product. This means that the product isn’t at the end of the deployment loop but that it is in the loop. Continuous service doesn’t end with delivery, but starts there.

## Great Artists Steal: Adding Git Support to Microsoft Visual Studio
{: #steal}

###Edward Thomson, Microsoft

![Edward Thomson](/cph15/images/speakers/ethomson.jpg){: .round #right} Edward Thomson is a Senior Software Development Engineer at Microsoft, where he develops Git integration for Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server. Edward is a core contributor to the libgit2 and LibGit2Sharp projects, which are the open-source Git libraries used by Microsoft tools (and many others). Edward is a contributing author to "Professional Team Foundation Server 2013," available from Wrox Publishing.

His speak at CoDe CPH has the title _Great Artists Steal_ it refers to the decision Microsoft made regarding the underlying versions control system of TFS, simply to cease development on their own technology and just give the users what the wanted: Git. The abstract in Ed's own words goes like this:

>In 2011, Microsoft was building "Team Foundation Version Control", a centralized version control system for enterprises.  Two years later, we were building Git support into Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server.  Learn how Microsoft avoided "not invented here" syndrome and adopted a great tool for its Distributed Version Control System by using Git (instead of creating an inferior copy of Git) and learn about the mistakes we made (and the ones we avoided) along the way.

## Continuous Delivery War stories - deploying 10 times per day

###Allan Ebdrup, E-conomics
![Allan Ebdrup](/cph15/images/speakers/eebdrup.jpg){: .round #left} Allan Ebdrup studied Computer Science at universities in Århus and København.
He has worked 16 years in IT as self-employed, developer, IT-architect, enterprise-architect, tech & team-lead.
Three years ago Allan took the leap form working with technologies from the evil empires of Microsoft, Oracle and IBM to working exclusively with Open Source technologies like Node.js, NoSql and MongoDB.
The talk is about how to do Continuous Delivery and deploy to production 10 times a day or more. The techniques in the talk can be used no matter if you are on an Open Source technology stack or not.

##NoOps - beyond the DevOps frontier!

###Lars Kruse, Praqma
![Lars Kruse](/cph15/images/speakers/lkruse.jpg){: .round #left} Lars Kruse, Continuous Delivery Coach and partner and co-founder of Praqma. Lars holds a M.Sc in computer science and communication theory and has many years of experience in software configuration management, processes automation, quality assurance and agile software development.

In his speak Lars takes DevOps one step beyond forming a happy collaborative relation between Dev and Ops. He advocates for an entirely elastic and automated R&D infrastructure, with the software developer in the driver's seat. In his own words:

>A glimpse into a very near future where where quality is actually built into the software, as opposed to glued on after it's finished. It's a future where software developers aren't dependent on IT Operations at all. In a Continuous Delivery NoOps world queues have disappeared, resources are available at your command and everything is automated.
