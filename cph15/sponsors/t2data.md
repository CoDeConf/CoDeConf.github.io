T2 Data is a provider of software applications, tools and services. Our tool for Continuous Delivery, MAIA, is designed to seamlessly integrate with other tools in the CD tool stack and provides a unified system overview by coordinating activities, code, configurations, builds, test, artifacts and deliveries in one interface. MAIA is designed to integrate with tools that our customers already use to achieve low setup barriers, while eliminating the need to work across multiple tools.<br/>
Our ambition is simply to enhance our customers' software development and delivery process by boosting visibility and collaboration; traceability and quality, to increase automation and manage complexity.
