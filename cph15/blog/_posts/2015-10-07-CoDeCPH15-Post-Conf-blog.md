# #CoDeCPH15

#The Continuous Delivery & <br> DevOps conference Copenhagen, October 7th 2015



**_"Good atmosphere. Energizing. You could feel the paradigm shift in the air"_**

**_"CoDeCPH avoided 'difficult second album syndrome' -  relevant and inspiring talks again this year"_**

**Conference**

With 200 international guests, the second CoDe conference in Copenhagen was brimming with both developers and operations staff, ready to gain insights, be inspired - and maybe even provoked.

Hotel Scandic Copenhagen was the venue and allowed for the entire crowd to be gathered in the grand conference room for a warm and not least sharp welcome by Lars Kruse from Praqma. He introduced the underlying conference slogan: Know your tools - practise your skills. The tagline encourages all tech people to keep their skills up to date, by testing new tools as well as practising the existing - and left the stage to 10 high profile speakers, all introducing their favorite tools and their take on how to keep them sharp.

**Speaks**

The first keynote speaker was Jan Bosch, Professor of Software Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, and he reminded the audience that technical debt will never disappear by magic, as components are passed on in the production line. Instead, small flaws that you plan to fix "sometime soon", is nothing but debt that will only grow - and as your faulty component is passed on, vicious cycles will appear in the entire product process.

Ed Thomson from Microsoft told the real-life story of how the company eventually stood up against "not invented here syndrome", when they made the decision to implement Git, over trying to make an ultimately inferior copy of their own.

After the two first talks, the guests could choose between two parallel tracks, including:

As the final keynote, Jim Coplien was invited to present his passionate thoughts as well as reservations about Continuous Delivery, - Deployment and - Integration.

Coplien brought his famous fiery spirit and ended the agenda with a feisty talk that asked the audience to always be critical in their choices and implementations of tools and methods.

Producing software extremely fast is neither saving you money nor earning you any, if you are not ready to deploy the product - it might just end up dusty and outdated on a virtual shelf.

After the gentle reminder from Coplien, the conference was wrapped up with an engaged panel discussion between the speakers, summing up some of the day's central audience questions about Continuous Delivery and the implications on markets, teams and processes in the software field.



The speakers - and some of the most active guests - were presented with an exclusive damascus steel knife, engraved with the words "Know your tools - Practise your knife skills".

The rest of the audience were encouraged to go out and practise their code tools - and to participate in the many smaller CoDe events in Scandinavia over the next year.
