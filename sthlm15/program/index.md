## Using Continuous Delivery to Build Products Customers Actually Use
{: #usingcd}

#### Keynote

######[Jan Bosch]({{site.root}}/speakers#jbosch), Chalmers University of Technology

Research shows that for a typical system, more than half of all the features are never used. This is a colossal waste of R&D effort and is caused by companies asking customers and users what they want. Users don't know what they want and it's the engineer's job to find out. The presentation shows how Continuous Delivery can address this challenge by providing a systematic approach to exploring a broad set of hypotheses about functionality that might add value for users at different stages of development. The presentation introduces the notion of Innovation Experiment Systems as a systematic method for optimizing the user experience of existing features, developing new features as well as developing new products. Continuous Delivery is discussed as it provides the core enabling technology for successfully implementing this approach. The presentation is based on data from eight industrial cases and stresses the importance of speed and rapid iterations in development. The presentation uses numerous examples from industry are used to illustrate the concepts.

## Estimates and Continuous Delivery
{: #estimates}

######[Seb Rose](/sthlm15/speakers#srose), Claysnow

Estimates are slippery things at the best of times, but they get a whole lot more slippery when combined with Continuous Delivery. In this session we discover that there is more than one kind of estimate and examine how they are typically used in an agile context. We’ll then dig a bit deeper to see how Continuous Delivery affects our approach, and whether there are any responsible alternatives to estimation. Along the way I hope to play a game or two with you, so be prepared to have some fun with estimates.

## NoOps - beyond the DevOps frontier!
{: #noops}

######[Lars Kruse](/sthlm15/speakers#lkruse), Praqma

DevOps is often referred to in the meaning; “to close the gap between Development and Operations”. This speak is a glimpse into the a very near future, where software developers aren’t dependent on Ops at all. In a NoOps world, queues have disappeared, resources are available at your command and everything is automated.

## Operational Excellence in Multi-disciplinary Product Development
{: #excellence}

######[Dag Arne Brænd](/sthlm15/speakers#lkruse), Novelda

Answering the following questions from an industrial point of view: How do you develop, control, and maintain an advanced SW codebase that distributes and ships into multiple HW products? How does Continuous Delivery of SW fit into such an environment? How do you set-up a SW quality toolchain that starts with design and ends up in a product at the customers desk?

## Continuous Integration as a step in the Stairway to Heaven Vision
{: #stairway}

######[Peter Thorngren](/sthlm15/speakers#pthorgren), Volvo GTT AB (Volvo Lastvagnar)

The automotive industry is on the verge of a fundamental revolution as the vehicle themselves becomes autonomous – CI and CD will play key roles in making this happened. The heavy duty truck industry will be in the center of this change. Trucks are already today advanced technical products with Internet integrated functions, but this is still very limited compared to what we will see in the upcoming years. This change will offer fascinating possibilities for innovation and creativity when trucks that already today have very advanced functions will be parts of integrated autonomous transport solutions.

## Lean Startup for B2B
{: #lean}

######[Andy Cars](/sthlm15/speakers#acars), Lean Ventures

Lean Startup is often associated with small agile B2C startups. But what about doing Lean Startup in a big corp. B2B environment? What are some of the challenges and how does it differ?

## Enterprise Scale Continuous Integration and Delivery: A Bunch of Problems and a Few Solutions
{: #problems}

######[Daniel Ståhl](/sthlm15/speakers#dsthaal), Ericsson AB

Continuous Integration and Delivery can be easier said than done - particularly in large scale: the size and complexity of the products increase, the number of stakeholders is greater, the volume of changes to integrate is larger and the stakes are higher.

What are the problems we run into when scaling continuous integration and delivery? What can we do about it? And how do we approach the problem?

## Analyzing Continuous Delivery
{: #analyzing}

######[Lars Bendix](/sthlm15/speakers#bendix), Lund University

How does Continuous Delivery (and DevOps) look like from “the Ivory Tower” (the academic point of view)? In this analysis, I will focus on why you might want to use Continuous Delivery and what you should probably look out for if you want to succeed. What are the advantages - big and small - that you can look forward to once you have Continuous Delivery in place? Furthermore, I will address what prequisites should be in place before starting and what kind of obstacles you should be prepared to meet. The analysis will be spiffed up with some practical experience (aka Lessons Learned) from primarily student projects - that might or might not relate to “your real world”.

## Boosting your agile mindset with Continuous Delivery
{: #boosting}

######[Christian Pendleton](/sthlm15/speakers#spendleton), Softhouse

Continuous Delivery and DevOps is an important piece of the infrastructure that is essential when you want to apply an agile way of working in an organization.
We would like to share our view on how an agile organization benefits from a working continuous delivery solution and tell the story about a successful large scale implementation from one of our customers.

## Continuous Delivery for Databases
{: #databases}

######[Marcus Philip](/sthlm15/speakers#mphilip), Diabol

How do you apply Continuous Delivery on complex database applications? Automation and Continuous Delivery are all the rage at the moment, but not so much for databases (DB). Only half of those that use CD for their applications use it for their DB. There is a mistrust in automation for the DB. But moving towards CD for the DB can increase productivity and shorten time to market, while at the same time reduce risk. In this talk, join our journey of moving towards CD for a complex Oracle DB application, treating DB schemas as code. We will present the rationale, the concepts, the considerations, the obstacles and what remains to be improved.
