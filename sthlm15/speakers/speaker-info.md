18. We would like the presenters (you!) on stage, answering questions or discussing topics that have been suggested by the audience during the day. _lease confirm that you would be comfortable and willing to attend the panel._
19. __Presentation guidelines__
20. We do not want to impose a certain template that you should use for your presentation. We expect that you'll be presenting from your own laptop and you're free to use any format that you like. Instead we merely want to state a few guidelines:

* __Please use the .png of the conference logo in the master of your slides, so that it appears on every slide.__
* __Please make the first slide contain the title of your presentation, as given to us together with your abstract (if you're going to use a different title - let us know in due time, so we can update program and agenda accordingly).__
* __You can of course present your background and the company or organization you represent, but please pay notice to the 7th TED commandment "Thau shall not sell from the stage...". Remember   that the audience has paid for the entrance, it's fair for them to expect an unbiased and entertaining speak.__
* __Actually, if you haven't already then then read through the TED commandments (they're in the right margin at the conference program). We sincerely hope that you find them inspiring - give them your best - we know you will!__

_OBS:_ **Please bring an adaptor for you computer - just to be sure.**

21. __Presentation deadline - May 28th__
22. We would like to review the slide deck you use for your presentation - _by Thursday May 28th._ It doesn't have to be absolutely final at that day, you can continue to tune and improve, but we would like the overall number of slides and the story to be representative for what you're going to end up with at that point.
23. __Presentation duration__
24. In case you aren't sure about the time time you have available for your presentation:

* __KeyNotes are 45minutes incl Q&A.__
* __Regular sessions are 30minutes incl Q&A.__
25. If you have any doubt, please look to the [online agenda](/sthlm15/agenda) where you'll find your presentation slot. We strive to stick to the program, so in case you feel you won't have time to do Q&A, we suggest that you encourage the audience to save their questions for the panel discussions or simply tweet their questions to [@codeSTHLM]() and we'll make sure that all questions are brought up at panel. (Don't worry, well inform attendees about this so they are aware)
26. Please address any replies or questions to (ah@praqma.net).

| Again, we really appreciate your effort and are looking forward to see you in Stockholm.
Please let us know if there are anything you need from us. |
