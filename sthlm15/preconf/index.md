#CoDeSTHLM Pre-Conference

##Birds of a Feather sessions

_Make the most of your trip to Stockholm_{: .inverted} __by taking advantage of the pre-conference _Birds of a Feather_ (BoF) sessions the day before conference. The pre-conference event consists of a series of lightning talks followed by Birds of a Feather discussions. It's designed to provide an in-depth introduction to Continuous Delivery and to allow sufficient time to dive into any depths of details that the participants wants to take. *You'll not be in the passenger seat, you'll be driving*.__

_Our BoFs are facilitated by hand picked Continuous Delivery and DevOps thought leaders_{: .inverted}

## It's free to attend - but don't stall: Seats are limited! First signed - first served!

The pre-conference day is laid out as an _un-conference_ meaning that the majority of the content will we given as discussions and knowledge sharing among participants and less by actual speakers. The format goes like this:

* The day is divided into sessions. Each session is approximately an hour.
* The sessions start with a series of three lightning talks - each is 5 minutes tops.
* After lightning talks we will run three Birds of a Feather sessions in parallel.
* One for each of the three topics presented in lightning talks.
* Each BoF will be lead and facilitated by one of the lightning speakers who will try to pull a crowd to attend his or hers BoF.
* After BoFs comes coffee or snack breaks. And then we'll start over again - three times in total.
* To wrap up the day we have invited a special guest speaker to light you up before we invite you all to come and have a beer and a bite to eat and the pre-conference [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/code-u/events/222344305/).

##Why are delivery pipelines so often red?
{: #pipelines}

_Facilitated by:_{: .inverted} Andrey Devyatkin, Ericsson AB.

Teams working with CI automation and operations are quite often associated with firefighter teams as there is always some small issue in the machinery, source code, test case or script that breaks your delivery flow when you least expect it. Hell breaks loose and all men are called on deck to fix the issue and restore the delivery flow so the work can continue. When one problem is fixed another is waiting just around the corner.  Sounds familiar?
This lightning talk and BoF is about how stability of the delivery pipeline will help you prevent firefighting and start benefitting from your automation solutions.

## Deliver or die
{: #deliver}

_Facilitated by:_{: .inverted} Johan Kardell, Softhouse

Sometimes we find ourselves in projects with modern technologies, serious automated testing, automated deliveries and working feedback loops. Sometimes we find ourselves in projects with fewer of those qualities. Sometimes we even stumble upon projects with none of those qualities. When we find ourselves knee deep in ancient legacy systems and the market demands higher quality at a higher pace, what do we do? Total rewrite is not an option. Feature freeze is not an option. There are no money to hire a new team…
This lightning talk and BoF is about quality assurance in legacy systems, and the reality is that we have to deliver or die.

##To Branch or Not to Branch
{: #branch}

_Facilitated by:_{: .inverted} Lars Kruse, Praqma.

Following up on a heated discussion that ignited at the Continuous Delivery & DevOps conference in Oslo in April: Can branching in a version control system be compliant with Continuos Integration and Continuos Delivery at all? Lars says _"Yes! - and it can even be automated"_ but in a [Google hangout](https://plus.google.com/u/0/hangouts/onair/watch?hid=hoaevent/c1mbqj6b93o6stcbl2qkdt8udmc&ytl=30yN4hefrt0&wpsrc=yta){: target="\_blank"} we had with Dave Farley, Steve Schmidt and Olve Maudal they all say _"No! - Only trunk based development is compliant with Continuous ...what ever - and even pretested intagrations are incompatible with CI"_. Take a dive into the heat in the blog post "[To Branch or Not to Branch](www.josra.org/blog/to-branch-or-not-to-branch.html){: target="\_blank"}"

## How do you spread CD in an organization?
{: #spread}

_Facilitated by:_{: .inverted} Gustav Rånby, Diabol.

The problem with spreading CD in an organization is that it has many aspects (TDD, automated testing, automated deployments, culture) and it affects several roles. Should you start automating your tests or should you start automating your deployments? Does automation drive culture or do you need good culture to maintain a working build pipeline? There are some common barriers to CD like starting to release directly from the main branch, release often to production or dividing the system into smaller components. It's like a leap of fait going from one paradigm to another - how do you convince others to make that leap? You are already on the inside and you have proved that it works so this should be easy, right?

##Continuous Delay - are DBA's the enemy?
{: #dba}

_Facilitated by:_{: .inverted} Jes Breslaw, Delphix

In the race to deliver faster and more often - data can slow you down.
What do you do? Reduce the frequency of refresh? Accept data subsets or synthetic data?
When it comes to provisioning data for development environments, even if you have buy in from operations it can still take days for DBA's to get you data, let alone refresh it. For test environments reseting the environment can take hours, come on DBA's - speed up! The time has come for developers to take control of data. Does that mean we even need DBA's any more? What about securing the data?
This Bird of a Feather will discuss the relationship between DBA's and application teams, and how to get the most by working together.

##Hosting cost for Nothing
{: #nothing}

_Facilitated by:_{: .inverted} Tom Benedictus, Container Solutions.

As long as a project can support a business case with a plus on the bottom line it has been accepted that hosting partners dig well into the profit. But what happens when development cost drops with higher competition and operations keeps coming with bills for three years of ownership in the region of millions? Will operations learn, will they be replaced, or will entire businesses fail due to competition in the Cloud?


## Glorious Failures during Swap Week
{: #campfire}

_Speaker:_{: .inverted} Shay Weiss, Spotify

Come and sit by the fire, fellow devopers, and I'll tell you all about a crazy habit called "Swap Week" at my squad. During squad weeks we take all our perfectly functional, stable, shiny, development-critical production infrastructure servers and shut them off in favor of newly spawned machines. Basically, we risk grinding all of the development infrastructure to halt (and even lose data), lose lots of money for the company, miss deadlines for the business and make sure we're all fired.

I'm gonna reveal to you why we pursue such madness, explain how it's done in a way that is actually beneficial, tell you how we gloriously failed (and thus dubbed Swap Week as a huge success) and, if you promise not to tell anyone, let you in on a few close-calls we had ;)
