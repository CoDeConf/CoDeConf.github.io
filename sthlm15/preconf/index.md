#CoDeSTHLM Pre-Conference

##Birds of a Feather sessions

_Make the most of your trip to Stockholm_{: .inverted} __by taking advantage of the pre-conference _Birds of a Feather_ (BoF) sessions the day before conference. The pre-conference event consists of a series of lightning talks followed by Birds of a Feather discussions. It's designed to provide an in-depth introduction to Continuous Delivery and to allow sufficient time to dive into any depths of details that the participants wants to take. *You'll not be in the passenger seat, you'll be driving*.__

_Our BoFs are facilitated by hand picked Continuous Delivery and DevOps thought leaders_{: .inverted}

The pre-conference day is laid out as an _un-conference_ meaning that the majority of the content will we given as discussions and knowledge sharing among participants and less by actual speakers. The format goes like this:

* The day is divided into sessions. Each session is approximately an hour.
* The sessions start with a series of three lightning talks - each is 5 minutes tops.
* After lightning talks we will run three Birds of a Feather sessions in parallel.
* One for each of the three topics presented in lightning talks.
* Each BoF will be lead and facilitated by one of the lightning speakers who will try to pull a crowd to attend his or hers BoF.
* After BoFs comes coffee or snack breaks. And then we'll start over again - three times in total.
* To wrap up the day we have invited a special guest speaker to light you up before we invite you all to come and have a beer and a bite to eat and the pre-conference [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/code-u/events/222344305/).
