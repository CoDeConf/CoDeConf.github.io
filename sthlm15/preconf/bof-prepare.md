#Birds of a Feather preparation

__If you are asked to give a lightning talk and run a BoF then we'd like to put an action on you first.__

For your lightning talk and Birds of a Feather session we need:

* __A title__ (hint: Describe the problem - not the solution)
* __A 100 words (tops) abstract__ (hint: reveal possible solutions to the problem)

When you come up with your BoF topic think in terms of something touching on as many as possible - preferably all four - of the following four abilities:

* _Complexity_{: .inverted} in terms of the tasks to be done or outcomes achieved
* _Diversity_{: .inverted} in terms of the people involved and/or needed to make any solution work
* _Conflict_{: .inverted} real or potential, meaning people really care about the central issue or purpose
* _Urgency_{: .inverted} meaning that the time to act was "yesterday".

Remember you'll be doing your lightning talk in _competition_ with two others - think _speakers corner_ in Hyde Park; the one who presents the most interesting case or topic will pull the largest crowd to the BoF.

Also remember that it's a lightning talk - __YOU ONLY HAVE 5 MINUTES!__ Which means that you probably only have time to present a problem - not the solution.

The solution is what will be discussed during the BoF.

## Facilitator
The BoF will run for 45 minutes and you will facilitate it. So consider to prepare a handful of bold or provocative statements during the BoF that can stir the pot and keep the conversation going.

A BoF where everyone agrees tends to be tame. You wanna start a fight, solve a problem, dig into nitty gritty details, create a sense of urgency.

Please submit your title and abstract to [events@praqma-net](events@praqma-net)
