## DevOps, Cloud and Your SDLC
{: #devops}

#### Keynote

######[Andi Mann]({{site.root}}/speakers#andimann), CA

By enabling new approaches to service delivery, cloud and DevOps together are delivering even greater speed, agility, and efficiency. No wonder leading innovators are adopting DevOps and cloud together!
This presentation will explore the synergies in these two approaches, with practical tips, techniques, research data, war stories, case studies, and recommendations.

Whether you are a startup or an enterprise; using private cloud, public cloud, or no cloud; an Agile noob or a DevOps pro; struggling with core banking systems, or building a new social/local/mobile app that will change the world (!); this session will give you actionable ideas on using cloud and DevOps together to revolutionize your software and service delivery lifecycle.

## Using Continuous Delivery to Build Products Customers Actually Use
{: #usingcd}

#### Keynote

######[Jan Bosch]({{site.root}}/speakers#jbosch), Chalmers University of Technology

Research shows that for a typical system, more than half of all the features are never used. This is a colossal waste of R&D effort and is caused by companies asking customers and users what they want. Users don't know what they want and it's the engineer's job to find out. The presentation shows how Continuous Delivery can address this challenge by providing a systematic approach to exploring a broad set of hypotheses about functionality that might add value for users at different stages of development. The presentation introduces the notion of Innovation Experiment Systems as a systematic method for optimizing the user experience of existing features, developing new features as well as developing new products. Continuous Delivery is discussed as it provides the core enabling technology for successfully implementing this approach. The presentation is based on data from eight industrial cases and stresses the importance of speed and rapid iterations in development. The presentation uses numerous examples from industry are used to illustrate the concepts.

## How to find & grow your own DevOps experts…
{: #howto}

######[Paul Speers]({{site.root}}/speakers#pspeers), Speerhead

The contractor market is booming for talented DevOps architects and engineers, salaries are rising. Finding and luring DevOps gurus to work on exciting truly transformation projects and creating and sustaining culture is highly challenging. Paul argues this is not a sustainable market dynamic with no real & proper training for new talent or existing IT engineers into the DevOps market.

In this session Paul discusses how can you grow the new breed of DevOps graduates, coders. How to do this, what methods to use, how to select talent from your current team and why you need to create a new IT world and sustain a DevOps culture. He maintains companies need help in on boarding new talent putting them through ‘on the job’ training covering not just coding but soft skills, meeting skills, IT automation, Open Source tooling and business process engineering.

## Continuous Delivery Maturity
{: #cdmaturity}

######[Lars Kruse]({{site.root}}/speakers#lkruse), Praqma

For most software development teams it is a major challenge keeping up with the rapidly changing requirements, while delivering quality software within budget and deadlines. Implementing Agile or Lean methods is a step in the right direction, but many teams find out that this doesn't really solve the problems. This presentation give a comprehensive introduction to the multifaceted landscape of Continuous Delivery, argue why it is an important part of the solution, and present some successful real-life implementations of a full Continuous Delivery automation. Based on Praqma's CD maturity model the presentation will demonstrate how the ability to continuously deliver working software requires a certain level of maturity in software development processes.

## Peer reviews are for sissies
{: #sissies}

######[Lars Kruse]({{site.root}}/speakers#lkruse), Praqma

Peer reviews are not a silver bullet. They often introduce validation in the QA process at a time where verification is really what's needed. Peer reviews represent unplanned work as well as queued work processes. The alternative: to automate your Continuous Delivery pipeline to an extend where you actually trust it to implement your definition of done - now that's lean!

## The implementation of Continuous Delivery at Ziggo (UPC-Liberty Global)
{: #cdziggo}

######[Michiel Sens]({{site.root}}/speakers#msens), Xebia

The new Ziggo.nl website was launched in April 2014 and was developed by multiple vendors, comprising many different technologies like Java, PHP, Hippo CMS and MySql. As the site was build from the ground up, Ziggo automated the complete software delivery process and managed to deliver faster, cheaper and better than ever before.

This presentation explains the key ingredients to making this project a real success, the project structure that was applied, an overview of the tooling that was implemented, provides examples on how these tools were implemented and explains the main differences between a traditional software delivery process and the optimized software delivery process that can be used for Continuous Delivery.

## DevOps At Scale
{: #scale}

######[Benjamin Wootton]({{site.root}}/speakers#bwootton), Contino

DevOps started life in ‘born on the web’ digital companies such as Facebook, Google, and Etsy.  As the movement has grown in size and prominence however, people are increasingly asking whether DevOps like practices can scale into bigger companies and how to get started on their own DevOps transformation.  

In this session, we will cover why DevOps is especially relevant in an Enterprise setting, covering some of the challenges how to overcome them.  We’ll bring this to life with examples from some of our clients, many of whom are already leveraging DevOps practices to get to market earlier and deliver better software, more efficiently.

## Implementing Continuous Delivery in practice for embedded devices
{: #embedded}

######[Jonas Bang Christensen]({{site.root}}/speakers#bang), Schneider Electric & [Rasmus Voss]({{site.root}}/speakers#voss), VossCon

A case story based on the experiences made from implementing Continuous Integration & Delivery at Nokia, and latest from an ongoing implementation at Schneider Electric. The presentation will take you through some of the challenges of how to convert the abundance of theories, concepts, and tools of Continuous Integration & Delivery, and in practice how to implement these into legacy embedded device projects using C, .Net, Java, and silverlight.

The speakers will share their views and advice on how to tackle change management, how to convince management of the importance of Continuous Integration & Delivery, which tools to use, where to begin, and what exactly is the difference between having and using version control.
The presentation will be concrete, but subjective, so consider yourself warned.

## Continuous Delivery X-rayed
{: #xrayed}

######[Lars Bendix]({{site.root}}/speakers#bendix), Lund University

How does Continuous Delivery (and DevOps) look like from "the Ivory Tower" (the academic point of view)? A lightning analysis of why you might want to use Continuous Delivery and what you should probably look out for if you want to succeed. Spiffed up with some practical experience (aka Lessons Learned) from student projects - that might or might not relate to "the real world".

## Robust functional- and integration testing earlier in the SDLC is mandatory when introducing Continuous Delivery
{: #sdlc}

######[Allan Tange]({{site.root}}/speakers#tange), Testhuset

As the adoption of agile development and Continuous Delivery increases, outcome like volume and frequents of releases put pressure on test and quality organizations. In order to address that, a more robust functional- and integration testing earlier in the SDLC is mandatory. However to accommodate that, production-like test environments are often needed and typically comes with a high cost. Occasional it is even impossible due to third party limitations.

This session will explain how the concept of Service Virtualization and automated testing is an enabler for improving the  quality of Software applications in a Continuous Delivery life cycle.

## A Business Case for Git
{: #git}

######[Nicola Paolucci]({{site.root}}/speakers#paolucci), Atlassian

So you want to go Git, but other stakeholders in your organisation aren't quite convinced it's worth the effort? This talk will explain why migrating to Git is a win for the whole business – not just developers. We'll give you the ammunition you need to convince your team that the switch to Git is a no-brainer.

## Game changing beliefs
{: #gamechanging}

######[Morten Elvang]({{site.root}}/speakers#elvang), DELTA

How can you create an organization where it's possible to have success with CoDe and devops? Imagine you can chose to believe in something and that choosing the right things can fundamentally change your luck in business? Is this at all a useful way to go about creating an effective and supportive organization? And, if so, what should you chose to believe in?

## DevOps Agility: Lifecycle Reporting & Dashboards
{: #agility}

######[Florin Iten]({{site.root}}/speakers#iten), QACube

The pace of change in DevOps is both a challenge and an opportunity. Successful enterprises know that they must look for new approaches which enable decision-making across the entire lifecycle. With so many different tools being used across the DevOps Cycle is there an easier way to provide transparency and visibility across projects, clusters, geographies, departments and divisions? How can enterprises leverage better decision making coupled with perfect resource planning for successful and predictable outcomes?

This session will explain analytics and C-Level views and reporting that covers the entire maturity curve from operational to monitoring to tactical to strategic views of the DevOps Cycle. Find out how Cross Border reporting can improve the quality of software DevOps and deliver the expert navigation essential to a “no wrong turns” Continuous Delivery Life Cycle.

Attendees will learn how to:<br clear="both">
• avoid false starts and wrong turns<br clear="both">
• get back on track<br clear="both">
• prioritize the risks and actions needed at every stage<br clear="both">
• lower risks and keep pace with apps<br clear="both">

As the adoption of agile development and Continuous Delivery increases, outcome like volume and frequents of releases put pressure on test and quality organizations. In order to address that, a more robust functional- and integration testing earlier in the SDLC is mandatory. However to accommodate that, production-like test environments are often needed and typically come at a high cost. Occasionally, it is even impossible due to third party limitations.

This session will explain how the concept of risk based DevOps and Analytics and All-in-One Reporting accelerates agility for improving the quality delivery of Software applications in a Continuous Lifecycle.

## DevOps and Moving the Elephant
{: #elephant}

######[Chris Gargiulo]({{site.root}}/speakers#gargiulo), Maersk Group Infrastructure Services

Introducing DevOps as a methodology for delivering business value into an existing organization has many challanges. One of the largest being that of going against long established norms and processes. In the presentation, 'DevOps and Moving the Elephant', I will present a brief history of the progress made within Maersk Line IT and now Maersk Group IS that have helped make the difference in being able to anchor critical changes in how IT infrastructure is delivered and managed using DevOps methods.

## On the way towards the vision of DevOps
{: #vision}

######[Per Arnold Blaasmo]({{site.root}}/speakers#blaasmo), Atmel Norway

A talk about the challenges and experiences for Atmel when moving from a Waterfall model to a DevOps model with Continuous Deployment, when doing software development in a global company.

## Making the Case for Review
{: #making}

######[Austin Bingham]({{site.root}}/speakers#bingham), Sixty North AS

Reviews are a powerful tool for building quality software, but it can sometimes be difficult to convince your team to use them. In this presentation we’ll look at the research behind reviews, the benefits they can provide, and some best practices for using them effectively. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll be able to make informed decisions about - and strong arguments for - using reviews on your projects.
