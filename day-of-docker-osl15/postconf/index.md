##Full day workshop: Taming microservices with CoreOS and Kubernetes
{: #khightower}

###Description

Linux containers are only part of the puzzle when designing large scale infrastructure for microservices. First you’ll need a host to run your containers, as the OS is still a requirement. Next you’ll need to configure your containers and deploy them in a way that utilizes your resources efficiently. When that’s all done, you’ll need a way for the services running inside your containers to announce and discover each other. Oh and you need to do all of that fast; manual processes don’t work at scale. A tall order no doubt, but CoreOS and Kubernetes have you covered.

After attending this tutorial you’ll know how to:

 - Provision a small CoreOS cluster
 - Package your applications as Linux containers
 - Manage application configurations with etcd
 - Implement service discovery and keep your sanity
 - Deploy and manage Linux containers with Kubernetes

###Materials or downloads needed in advance
Google Compute Engine account, a laptop, working SSH client, and GitHub account.
