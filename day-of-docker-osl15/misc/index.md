## Conference concept<br/>

The Jenkins User Events Scandinavia are focusing on gathering both current and soon-to-be users and developers of the Jenkins Continuous Integration server from all over Scandinavia to meet and get inspired by like minded peers and the presentations from community frontrunners as well as everyday Jenkins users.

The event offers plenty of opportunity to network and get into rewarding discussions with Jenkins peers. In short, the JUES seeks to provide a venue for stakeholders within the Jenkins CI community to meet other people and companies who are equally engaged in Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration with Jenkins and make valuable connections for the future.

### Catering

### The  Jenkins CI Code Camp

Each year, in conjunction with the JUES, Praqma also arranges The Jenkins CI Community Code Camp. It's always on the day before the User Event and has become one of our most popular events, where Jenkins peers band together to contribute content back to the community. Often the Code Camp is visited by community celebs - so this is a great opportunity to “code with the stars”.
The intended audience for Code Camp is both experienced Jenkins developers and developers who are looking at getting started with Jenkins plugin development.
