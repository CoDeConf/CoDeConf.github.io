## Day of Docker

# A full day of Docker

## Hands-on, energizing and fun

{% include /day-of-docker/slider.html %}


###### We’ve made a wish list of all the things a great developer-event should have. And now you are invited to join us for the very first Day of Docker:

### All aspects of Docker, for Developers of all experience levels

* See, hear and learn about the technology
* Explore the Docker ecosystem hands-on
* Discuss the subjects that are central to you

### Subjects and learning styles for everyone

* Tech demonstrations
* Workshops in smaller groups
* Final keynote by Kelsey Hightower

### Social, delicious, and fun

* Beautiful venue
* Traditional Norwegian “Julebord” dinner prepared by a top chef
* Band, DJ, and craft beer to finish the day perfectly

### Day of Docker is not your average conference - and we can’t wait to see you in Oslo!
