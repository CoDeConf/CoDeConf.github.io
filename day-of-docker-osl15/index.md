The afternoon will culminate with a smashing Keynote talk given by Kelsey Hightower. In the evening we'll throw a party with a traditional Norwegian _julebord_ buffet, followed by some fantastic entertainment.

Developers of all experience levels will learn about and all different aspects of Docker by becoming truly interactive. From introductory sessions on creating and running Docker containers, to advanced composition and orchestration in cloud environments, there is sure to be something for everyone!

## Julebord
We will finish the day with a fantastic Julebord provided by a top chef. There will also be a band, a DJ, and lot's of fun!

## Call for workshops
Day of Docker is much more than the usual procession of presentations and papers where everyone sits still.... If you have something interesting to share about Docker and would like to in run a workshop we want to hear from you!  Please send a mail to [mil@praqma.net](mailto:mil@praqma.net) to discuss your thoughts.

Here are some of the topic areas that we are especially interested in:

 * Best practices with networking, storage, or security
 * Docker at scale
 * What's new in docker 1.9
 * Docker in the wild (but these must bring educational value)
