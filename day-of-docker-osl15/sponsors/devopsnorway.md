This is a group for anyone interested in DevOps and Continuous Delivery of software in general. All skill levels are welcome. We started this group to meet other enthusiasts. Looking forward to exploring the possibilities with everybody interested in these topics. We are especially interested in getting in contact with other enthusiasts from other companies and communities, who are interested in being a part of this community and participate in hosting the events.
