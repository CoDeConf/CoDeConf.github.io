![Jon Jagger](/day-of-docker-osl15/images/speakers/JonJaggerHelloWorld.JPG){: .round #left}
Hi. I'm Jon Jagger. I'm a self employed software consultant specializing in practice, process, TDD, and complex-adaptive systems-thinking. I've worked with Accenture, Aviva, Cisco, Ericsson, Friends Provident, HP, Microsoft, Operator, Ordnance Survey, RBS, Reuters, Renault F1, Schlumberger, Tandberg and many many more. I'm 30 years old (hex) and I've loved software since I was 10 (decimal). I live in Somerset in England. I'm married to the beautiful Natalie and dad to Ellie, Penny and Patrick. I love coarse fishing and salmon fishing. I'm the ex ACCU conference chairman. I've had some C# books published. I'm the co-author with Olve Maudal of the Deep C/C++ slide deck (over 600,000 views). On twitter I'm @JonJagger. I built cyber-dojo.org to promote deliberate practice for software developers.

> [http://cyber-dojo.org](http://cyber-dojo.org) is an open-source browser-based environment where individuals or teams can practise programming.
Under the hood it uses docker - but in an unusual way.
In this presentation I'll recount the story of cyber-dojo, starting from its origin - in the Scotsman pub in Oslo in 2009!
I'll do a brief demo, talk about various aspects of its design and some core principles on which the design is based.
I'll discuss how it has evolved, whose helped, some of the difficulties it's faced, and where it might by heading.

<br/><br/><br/><br/>



>If you thought Continuous Delivery was “the future”, you are falling behind the curve.
>
>In this hands on workshop, we will have a look at how Docker is already making ‘classic’ CoDe setups look old-school …
You will learn how to set up a Jenkins based continuous delivery environment running in Docker containers.  We will use this to build, test and deploy a well known open source project using stock and custom Docker containers for the various tasks.
>
>Along the way, you will gain experience building and running your own Docker containers, use Jenkins CI and its Docker plugin, and have built and run a project all within the confines of Docker containers running on cloud infrastructure.
>
> **Prerequisites**
>
>Every participant is expected to:
>
>  - bring a laptop with a working SSH client (any OS)
>  - have an account on GitHub (takes 2 minutes or less if you don’t have one).
>  - Have basic experience with Docker, maybe from the Docker 101 workshop earlier in the day, or from an evening playing at home.  I.e. you have a basic understanding of the Docker concept, and at least tried to pull and run existing images, and preferably at least tried to build one from a Dockerfile. Experience with Docker Compose and Docker Swarm is not necessary.

>Docker plays an increasingly important role in building and operating modern applications, both on-premises and in the cloud. In this introductory workshop, you will get an end-to-end understanding of Linux containers and how to operate and orchestrate them at scale. The course will teach you about the low-level concepts that make up Linux containers, how to deploy Docker containers, and how to orchestrate them using tools like Kubernetes and Mesos/Marathon.
>
> At the end of the workshop you will have achieved the following learning goals:
>
>- Understand container basics (cgroups, namespaces) as well as Docker
>- Will be able to find and launch pre-defined Docker images and troubleshoot containers (inspecting and logging)
>- Understand orchestration options (Kubernetes, Mesos/Marathon, Docker Swarm, Nomad)
>- Understand deployment options (standalone, Google Container Engine, Amazon ECS, DCOS)
>- Will have implemented an end-to-end application using Docker, Kubernetes, and Marathon
>
>**Audience:** This workshop is particularly useful for application developers, devops, architects, and anybody interested in Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos/Marathon.
>
>_Note:_ that the hand-on sessions will be carried out on [Mesosphere DCOS](https://mesosphere.com/product/) clusters, which will be set up for the teams.
>
>All you need is a laptop with a Linux shell, and git installed. Linux/MacOS laptops preferred, but if you have a Windows laptop, make sure you've VirtualBox installed.

>Once a project moves beyond a simple set of containers, it readily becomes apparent that keeping track of the state and location of services is critical. In this workshop we'll explore and try out various service discovery and catalog approaches, running the gamut from Docker links to DNS based catalogs like Consul and SkyDNS. We'll also look at related catalog features like dynamic config file generation and service health checks.


## Microservices at Scale with Nomad and Consul on elastic infrastructure.

>The Microservices architecture is becoming more common for writing scalable modern services targeted for public and private clouds. However, the architecture brings in with itself a lot of challenges with respect to availability, reliable inter-process communication across services, deployment orchestration and operations.  In this talk, I will go into how to design and run Microservices at scale on Docker and elastic infrastructure.
>
> We will cover the following topics in the talk-
>
   * Challenges of running services on commodity hardware and commodity network
   * Reacting to traffic and failures at scale with a reactive cluster scheduler for running containers.
   * Discovering services with Consul and inter-process communication on dynamically changing network topology of services
   * Need for a distributed and parallel cluster scheduler for running Containerized workload
   * Architecture and Internals of Nomad
   * Hands on tutorial with Nomad and Consul to run services. We will cover the process of bootstrapping a Nomad cluster and Consul.
  The users will learn how to register services running on Nomad with Consul.
