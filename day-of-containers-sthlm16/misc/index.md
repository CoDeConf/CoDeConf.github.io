# All the information you need...<br/>

## Conference concept<br/>


### Hands-on workshops, at eye-level!

We are enthusiastic about containers (Hey, they allow us to build, ship, and deploy faster, smoother and better!) 

And when we are ready to learn new things, enthusiasm is always the key word: 


* Handpicked speakers from around the world who can’t wait to share their newest knowledge with you. 
* Venues that makes us feel exited. 
* Room for you to chat, snack and have fun.


Highly qualified experts guarantee you the professional level that makes your day worth while - and a great variety of workshops will equip you to go home and apply all your new skills.


## Catering

As always, lunch, drinks and snacks are included and served on-site throughout the day.
