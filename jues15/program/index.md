##Kohsuke Kawaguchi, CloudBees and Jenkins Creator
![Kohsuke Kawaguchi](/jues15/images/speakers/kkawaguchi.jpg){: .round #right}Kohsuke Kawaguchi is a well-respected developer and popular speaker at industry and Jenkins community events. He’s often asked to speak about his experience and approach in creating Jenkins; a CI platform that has become a widely adopted and successful community-driven open source project. The principles behind the Jenkins community – extensibility, inclusiveness, low barriers to participation – have been the keys to its success. Kohsuke’s sensibilities in creating Jenkins and his deep understanding of how to translate its capabilities into usable software have also had a major impact on CloudBees’ strategy as a company.

##Praqma & Zetta Work

###Jan Sørensen,Praqma
![Jan Sørensen](/jues15/images/speakers/jsørensen.jpg){: .round #left}This presentation will demonstrate a one-click provisioning of infrastructure for a Continuous Delivery pipeline. The pipeline is Docker based, i.e. each service in the pipeline is implemented as a Docker image. The pipeline consists of typical Continuous Delivery services like Jenkins master, Jenkins slaves (provisioned on demand), Artifactory. The provisioning of Docker host is done with docker-machine, orchestration with docker-compose, and scaling with docker-swarm.<br/><br/><br/>

## Continuous Deployment to the Device

###Mikkel Arentoft, SCAUT

![Mikkel Arentoft](/jues15/images/speakers/marentoft.png){: .round #right} Mikkel Arentoft (M. Sc. in Computer Science) is principal consultant at Rehfeld and the lead architect of the Scaut. Mikkel has developed software professionally since 1998 and in a lot of areas such as monitoring, planning, GIS, traffic control, finance and health care. Mikkels primary area of interests are lean based software development and architecture  Publishing.
Scaut is an interdisciplinary research and development project based in Copenhagen, Denmark. The project runs from 2014-2018 and aims to support collaboration of patients and clinicians around early detection of signs and symptoms. In this project, we develop an app that allows patients to take action on their condition from home and a clinical platform that uses advanced analytics to predict deterioration.

##Version your build process as you version your code with Literate plugin

###Vincent Latombe, Amadeus
![Vincent Latombe](/jues15/images/speakers/vlatombe.png){: .round #left} Vincent is a developer advocate in Amadeus. He worked for many years are a build manager, building hundreds of projects for airlines and travel agencies. He focuses mostly on build, automation and developer productivity. Vincent is currently the maintainer for the Clearcase plugin and contributes also to core, Git and literate plugins.
The Literate plugin allows a project to define its build process directly in a description file (Markdown or YAML supported). Project owners have control over their build process and can refactor it as they refactor their code, while reusing all of the Jenkins goodness. Meet this beautiful plugin and fall in love with it!

##How To Connect Your Slave

###Robert Sandell, CloudBees
![Robert Sandell](/jues15/images/speakers/rsandell.jpg){: .round #right}Robert recently joined CloudBees as a Jenkins developer, and before that he developed and maintained the Jenkins installations at Sony Mobile. He has been a Jenkins community member since 2010 and is maintainer of several plugins like the Gerrit Trigger and Build Failure Analyzer. Perhaps most importantly, he is an enjoyer of fine Calvados.
There are many plugins in Jenkins for connecting slaves in various ways. How do they work and is there anyone better than the other?

##Test Driven Development in Excel

###Laurits Søgaard Nielsen, Visual Reporting
![Laurits Søgaard Nielsen](/jues15/images/speakers/nsnielsen.jpg){: .round #right}Briefly speaking, we have developed a tool for Excel that allows Excel developers to: Put code sheets and Excel files in Git, develop VBA test driven and perform unit and acceptance tests on code and sheets. In addition, we have integrated all of this into Jenkins pipelines, which means that we can test 8 different Excel platforms in parallel and run static code analysis of the VBA code. All this reduces the number of errors that can happen when developing Excel - and documents the business rules of the business in tests.
