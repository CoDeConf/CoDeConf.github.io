##Jenkins CI Community Event - 2014 

### Hi All Speakers.

We really appreciate the effort you are contributing with at this years conference, and we hope that you are all going to shine and entertain. Please let us know if there are anything you need from us.

We do have a bit of practical information to you that you should know. And we need some additional information from you that we will ask you to provide to us simply by filling out the form embedded in the bottom of this page.

#### Presentation template

We do not want to impose a certain template that you should use for your presentation. We expect that you'll be presenting from your own laptop and you're free to using any format that you like. Instead you merely want to state a few guidelines:

  * Please put the conference logo in the master of your slides, so that it appears on every slide. You can get it in a [light version](/images/jcicph14_master-light.png){: target="_blank" } or a [dark version](/images/jcicph14_master-dark.png){: target="_blank" }.
  * Please make the first slide contain the title of your presentation, as given to us together with your abstract (if you're going to use a different title - let us know in due time, so we can update program and agenda accordingly).
  * You can of course present your background and the company or organisation you represent, but please pay notice to the 7th TED commandment _"Thau shall not sell from the stage..."_. Remember that the audience has paid for the entrance, it's fair for them to expect an unbiased and entertaining speak.
  * Actually, if you haven't already then then read through the TED commandments (they're in the right margin at the conference program). We sincerely hope that you find them inspiring - give them your best - we know you will!

#### Presentation deadline - August 15th
We would like to review the slide deck you use for your presentation a week before - that is Friday August 15th. It doesn't have to be absolutely final at that day, you can continue to tune and improve, but we would like the overall number of slides and the story to be representative for what your're going to end up with at that point.
Please send your slides to [events@praqma.net](mailto:events@praqma.net).

__We're looking forward to see you__
