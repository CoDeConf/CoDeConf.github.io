###### These are the ground rules:

* **All sponsors on the stage**  standing up on a line.
* **You will do this _a capella_**. You will not have any slides to assist you.
* **You are welcome to bring requisites** (e.g. posters, roll-ups, brochures etc) on the stage with you.
* **You got less than 300 seconds** - 5 minutes, then _microphone cut_! So please plan within this margin.
* **It's your pitch** - You are welcome to use your time on stage for anything you like, including selling you product or recruiting Jenkins experts.


###### A disposition for you pitch could be something like:

This is just for inspiration - it's your pitch

* Who are you?
* What do you do?
* Why are you engaged in the Jenkins CI community?
* Why do you sponsor the event?
* Sell ...whatever you're selling.
* Call to action!
