At CloudBees, we believe the cloud is the new platform.

Our vision is to free developers from infrastructure maintenance duties so they can focus 100% on developing great applications. The CloudBees Platform as a Service (PaaS) enables that vision.

The CloudBees Platform features Jenkins in the cloud for its core development service, DEV@cloud. CloudBees also offers Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees, a subscription-based offering built on top of Jenkins CI.
