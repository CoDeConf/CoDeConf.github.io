#Dear Jenkins friends!

######It’s time to get together again. Two events in two days: It’s almost a Jenkins festival!

Based on the feedback we have received from the previous years, we have chosen to make the conference less commercial and more user-centric. We have fewer commercial sponsors and we therefore we need community sponsors.

We sincerely hope that a community sponsorship is attractive and something that you might consider. Basically, a community sponsorship is an exclusive group ticket that includes 5 people. The price of the sponsorship is DKK 10.000 - which is about double up on the ordinary ticket price. In return we have thrown some goodies in the bag, so besides the good community karma you also get valuable exposure of your business within the Scandinavian Jenkins community.

As a community sponsor you get:

* 5 tickets to the Jenkins user event (at the University of Copenhagen, Aug. 22nd).
* 5 tickets to the Jenkins code camp (Allerød Aug. 21st).
* You'll receive a promotion code valid 5 times foe each ticket type - share it as you please with colleagues, customers, partners, friends etc.
* Your logo on the JCICPH web, http://www.jcicph.dk/sponsors
* Your logo on the conference roll-ups.
* Your logo in the printed program.
* Your logo on the conference SWAG: A Nalgene water bottle (see mock-up picture; [Conference SWAG](/images/jcicph_swag_mockup.png).
* A 5 minute pitch in our sponsor line-up on the main track immediately after the welcome in the morning.

You simply purchase your sponsorship as a group ticket online, where you would also [purchase regular tickets](http://jcicph14.eventbrite.com){: target="_blank"}. In case you have already purchased your tickets, please contact us first, and we will of course deduct the expenses you've already had.

The deadline for getting your logo on the water bottle is **Friday, Aug. 1<sup>st</sup> ...2<sup>nd</sup> at the very very latest - which is soon!**

Please let us know (Send mail to [Adam](mailto:ah@praqma.net)) in case this is of your interest and you are considering a sponsorship, we might have to keep a short feed-back loop in order to make it before the deadline.

We hope to see you soon either as sponsor or attendee!
