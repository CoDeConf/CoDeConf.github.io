## in the heart of Copenhagen.

######The one and only Scandinavian conference for Jenkins users, by <br/>Jenkins users!

_JUES_{: .inverted} For the 4th consecutive year JUES - The Jenkins User Event Scandinavia gathers current as well as soon-to-be Jenkins users to network and harness inspiration from peers on best practice and application of Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and agile development with Jenkins.

The program will consist of invited and contributed speaks, tech talks, and case stories from experienced Jenkins CI developers, community frontrunners, executives, and others who are engaged in building quality software and accelerating the delivery process through Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.

_Jenkins CoDeCamp_{: .inverted} As always we'll kick off the JUES on the day before with The Jenkins CI CoDeCamp - a full day community event where developers learn from fellow developers on coding and plugin enhancement, all delivered back to the community.

We welcome you and other leading Jenkins developers, QA, DevOps, and operations personnel to this years Scandinavian Jenkins CI festival hoping to continuously support the growth of the Jenkins Open Source community.
