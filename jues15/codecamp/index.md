#Jenkins CI Code Camp 2015
__August 11th, 2015 at Praqma Copenhagen__



######The Code Camp is open to both developers with prior Jenkins CI development experience as well as developers with some Java experience who are impatient to get started and want an intraveineuse shot of Jenkins - that's it! You don't have to have a lot of ideas yourself in order to participate. We guarantee a lot of interesting topics and each session will have an designated facilitator.
