#Jenkins CI Code Camp 2014
__August 21st, 2014 at Praqmaplex__

######It has become a tradition that we host a Jenkins CI Code Camp on the day prior to the User Event. This full day event appeals to both established Jenkins CI developers and developers all new to Jenkins CI. The Code Camp has it's own designated Trello board [Go there](https://trello.com/b/bYqSkh1e){: target="_blank"} and see what's cooking"

__The format of the Code Camp__ is inspired by Open Space Technology where focus is dictated by constituency, which secures high levels of active participation from attendees.

__Bring your own topics__ - prior to the Code Camp we will contact attendees and make a "call for topics". The different topic suggestions will all be added to a backlog and at the Code Camp we will simply cast votes to find the most popular ones. Then we split out into smaller groups and work with these topics in timeboxed sessions.

__The Code Camp is open__ to both developers with prior Jenkins CI development experience as well as developers with some Java experience who are impatient to get started and want an intraveineuse shot of Jenkins - that's it! You don't have to have a lot of ideas yourself in order to participate. We guarantee a lot of interesting topics and each session will have an designated facilitator.

Very efficient and very fun!

The venue will be PraqmaPlex, our own facilities as well as the nearby Mungo Park Theatre, which will provide cozy surroundings. In order to secure optimal surroundings for the camp, seats are limited to 35 - so if you wanna go, don't hesitate!.

Last year the Code Camp featured programmers from 12 different companies as well as the founding father of Jenkins, Kohsuke Kawaguchi and community frontrunner Jesse Glick. This year we are expecting the same crowd as well as many more.  

The Code Camp will have food, drinks, great company and of course â€“ a lot of Jenkins CI!

Sign up and stay tuned for more details on this day of Jenkins CI coding to remember!

###### Join the camp and learn how to build your first plugin from scratch
{: #plugin_from_scratch}

![Jenkins plugin development](/images/jciplugindev.jpg){: .stdleft} In the first work session, [Mads Nielsen](https://github.com/MadsNielsen){: target=":_blank"}, a skilled Jenkins plugin developer from Praqma, will offer an alternative session for all people new to Jenkins CI. He will demonstrate how to build your first plugin from scratch and give a guided tour in the basics of the Jenkins Ci object model and it's extension points.

He will do this with off-set from a generic Jenkins plugin he has developed for the purpose, which you can freely fork on GitHub and start implementing your own good idear immediately.

It's a drilled down fast-paced version of [Praqma's Jenkins CI Plugin Developer training class](http://www.praqma.com/events/jciplugindev){: target="_blank"}.

__If you are focused you'll be able to learn Jenkins CI programming before lunch and release your first plugin before dinner.__
