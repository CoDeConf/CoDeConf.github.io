# Version Control and Continuous Integration

###### Guest blog by, [Sven Erik Knop](http://localhost:4000/speakers/#knopp), Perforce Software

In recent years continuous integration (CI) has become an essential tool to insure code quality and help with agile development, and Jenkins is one of the most popular tools in this space. Coming from a Version Control System (VCS) vendor, I wondered: how does a CI system and a VCS system interact? What are the mutual benefits?

At the [Jenkins Conference 2014 in Copenhagen](http://www.jcicph.dk) I want to talk about relationship between a CI system like Jenkins and an SCM system like Perforce or Git, the different usage patterns and especially the role of code review tools as the glue between CI and SCM system.

Perforce has recently submitted its own [Jenkins plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Perforce+Plugin){: target="_blank"} to the community that simplifies the integration and speeds up the builds. The plugin has been greatly anticipated with early adopters and we have received valuable feedback. I would like to demonstrate some of the aspects of this plugin at the end of [my talk](/program/#versioncontrol).
