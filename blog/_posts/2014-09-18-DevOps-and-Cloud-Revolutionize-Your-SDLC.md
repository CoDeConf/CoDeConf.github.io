![Andi Mann](/images/speakers/andimann.jpg){: .portrait}In todays technology environment, disruption is the name of the game. Try new services, new ideas, new products; move faster than competitors, faster than you ever have before; work better together, collaborate with partners, form new alliances, because the whole is more than the sum of the parts.

And it is the application that has been the driver of so much of this radical disruption. New systems of engagement have emerged, connecting businesses with customers on mobile devices, on social media, through consumer analytics, through digital marketing. New systems of innovation have emerged too, from emerging API-driven data platforms to wearable computing and the 'Internet of Things. Everyone wants the new killer app, the new digital disruptor, the new radical innovation.

This new culture of disruption driven by technology and applications was initially evident in cloud computing. Cloud offered an new ability to drive change faster, to allow ideas to flourish, to help business leaders to get or own technology, as never before. New empires like Google, Salesforce, and Facebook have thrived. Disruptive forces like Uber, AirBnB, Twitter, and Square have traditional executives panicking. New cloud models and the capabilities they enable have fundamentally and irreversibly changed our world.

Then came DevOps â€“ a philosophy as much as anything, aimed to accelerate the flow of applications (and the new disruptive functionality they bring) through the software delivery lifecycle (SDLC). With an approach that focuses on culture, automation, measurement, and sharing, DevOps is aimed at breaking down the wall between Dev and Ops that has historically made application delivery slow, complex, costly, and uncompetitive.

The DevOps movement started in smaller organizations, and has been undeniably successful, proven not just by one-off stories but by empirical research and independent reviews. More recently, larger businesses have started to adopt DevOps approaches, and now every day I am working with large banking, insurance, manufacturing, entertainment, and other organizations that are achieving phenomenal results from DevOps. Faster releases, fewer errors, lower costs, new products, higher productivity, and more are quickly becoming table stakes for large enterprises, just as they have always been for startups and small businesses.

Cloud computing started a technology revolution; now DevOps is driving that revolution forward. Both focus on speed and agility; both radically transform the application delivery model; both drive competitive capabilities that would not be possible without them. By enabling new approaches to service delivery, cloud and DevOps together are delivering even greater speed, agility, and efficiency. No wonder leading innovators are adopting DevOps and cloud together!

I will be using my talk at the upcoming CoDe  conference in Copenhagen to explore the synergies in these two approaches, to help attendees understand how these technologies come together to help businesses accelerate and improve the technology lifecycle that underpins the most modern radical revolutions. With practical tips, techniques, research data, war stories, case studies, and recommendations, I am planning to show attendees how to:

*	Embrace, source, consume, and expose shared services across the SDLC
*	Apply automation lessons from the cloud to deliver 'software-defined everything'
*	Accelerate time from ideation to release for new applications and services
*	Drive service efficiency and scalability while better managing cost and risk
*	Establish more effective feedback loops, from pre-planning to post-production
*	Secure rapid access to cloud infrastructure, platform, and software services

Whether you are a startup or an enterprise; using private cloud, public cloud, or no cloud; an Agile noob or a DevOps pro; struggling with core banking systems, or building a new social/local/mobile app that will change the world (!); this session will give you actionable ideas on using cloud and DevOps together to revolutionize your software and service delivery lifecycle.
