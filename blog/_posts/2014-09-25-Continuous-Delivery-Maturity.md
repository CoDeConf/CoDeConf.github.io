## Continuous Delivery Maturity

![Lars Kruse](/images/speakers/lars_kruse.jpg){: .portrait} Continuous Delivery is a software development approach that enables teams to always have releasable code in stock. Through the means of automation and extensive tool support, quality assurance is literally built into every single step of the process and is being continuously enforced, enabling corporations to continuously deliver quality software in line with user feedback, shifts in markets and changes to business strategy.

#### Continuous Delivery Defies Phases
Software development is iterative by nature. Each release is followed by another and regarded as a separate cycle founded on the previous one. Traditionally the software development process is perceived as having phases such as development, integration, deployment, testing, and release, but unfortunately these phases are all notoriously unpredictable. The release date cannot be planned. The solution is to automate all consolidation and verification steps and execute them upon every
single commit.

Continuous Delivery is a different approach for organizing the development process. It’s a strategy that defies phases. Instead it introduces extensive automation and execution of tests as well as verifications upon every single commit from the developers. The   doctrine is that each commit is a potential release candidate – you just have to test it to see if it is – or not. Continuous Delivery advocates that you always have releasable code in stock, so when the release date comes, you simply just push the release button.

#### Signs of Continuous Delivery Maturity
Some of the first steps towards a Continuous Delivery pipeline can be very cheap low hanging fruits; ripe, juicy, and simply there for any modern development team to pick. Other steps might require such a large effort, that the return of investment is in the scope of the long term strategic planning in the line organization and potentially not interesting for the typical project oriented focus in software development. In other words; implementing Continuous Delivery is very much a discipline of recognizing when enough is enough.

During our work in Praqma helping many different companies in their implementation of Continuous Delivery and through the seminars, conferences, and training classes we conduct, some of the most common questions we get in the field of Continuous Delivery are “where do we start”, “what to do next”, “what’s the benefit of that particular step”. When it comes to Continuous Delivery we have learned to recognize the various signs that indicate different levels of maturity, and we have used them to create a model. We use the model to systemize and categorize our findings, observations, and recommendations.

#### The Continuous Delivery Maturity Model
The model is organized so that the signs to the left are those we typically see with novice users and teams, while the ones to the right are typical signs of the experts. Horizontally in the model we have organized the signs in different categories. Build, Test & Quality Assurance, Software Configuration Management (SCM), and Visibility. But one thing we have learned since releasing this model is, that even though we have strived to use broad categories that embrace most of our findings, we have realized that the disciplines that are influenced by Continuous Delivery exceed the number of categories we have included in the model today. A natural development of the model could be a horizontal expansion into more areas where especially “system design & architecture” and “organizational culture” are obvious candidates.

#### The perfect model?
We recognize that that the model does not necessarily provide you with a complete maturity chart. Thus, we knowingly use the statement that this is a chart of signs that indicate different levels of maturity. It could easily have included more categories such as design, system architecture, organizational culture, and probably even more. The fact that Continuous Delivery embraces such a diversity of disciplines is a point by itself. Caring for and developing your Continuous Delivery pipeline can be an important catalyst for driving the change that is required to enable a release strategy and software quality that is expected by today’s end-users.

The point is, that, poorly managed malfunctioning products are being punished by the end-users with the hardest sentence possible; they are simply being abandoned in favor of more mature and complete products. Those companies who master Continuous Delivery in the near future may see this as a competitive advantage, however at Praqma we predict, that within just very few years Continuous Delivery will be considered a competitive necessity!

#### What to expect
With the Continuous Delivery Maturity Model as startingpoint this presentation will give you a comprehensive introduction to the vocabulary and concepts of Continuous Delivery and show you how it can bring value to your business. I will dig into a selected range of areas that all contribute to, and are prerequisites for, development teams and organizations being fit to set off on a successful Continuous Delivery journey. The presentation will be underpinned by edifying tales from the trenches of successful real-life implementations of full Continuous Delivery automation.


You are hereby challenged to take the Continuous Delivery Maturity Test prior to the conference and come see us at our booth with your score and recommendations and we'll go over them with you.

Looking forward to see everyone at conference!
